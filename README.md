# Image-Processing-for-Olive-oil-adulteration-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
The adulteration in olive oil is one of the widely existing oil quality problem. Technique known as image processing has been used in this work
to determine adulteration in olive oil with other oils. Image classification is done on the dataset created which is comprised of
adulterated and pure olive oil used for olive oil adulteration detection. Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier were implemented on the dataset and their evaluation parameters were investigated. Also,
Artificial Neural Network was implemented for the classification of the dataset and parameters like accuracy, loss and confusion matrix have also been evaluated. The findings from this proposed study could be utilised to distinguish between olive oil that has been
contaminated with other vegetable oils at levels ranging from 0% to 50%.
